Function Pointer variable Design

Data type: FinCType_Func
The raw data of function variable is address of a FinCFunc variable.

1. Called in Foreign

2. Called in Script
get the FinCFunc variable through node evaluate, and then call it.
example 1:
pointer ptr=printf;
when reach the 'printf' symbol, FinC will generate a FinCData as pointer type.
while this FinCData's raw point to the really FinCFunc type variable.

example 2:
ptr("this is a function varablie test\n");
